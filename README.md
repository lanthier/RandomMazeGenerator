# RandomMazeGenerator
A random maze generator on a canvas written in javascript and painted on a Canvas.

## Improvements Made
- Increased Aldous Broder algorithm speed by counting visited instead of checking entire 2D array. { O(n^2) speed previously }
- Fixed Sidewinder algorithm and removed hot-fix.
- Refactored variable and function names.

## Future Development Plans
- Have more algorithms available.
- Change variable names inside algorithms
- Futher improve algorithm speed
- Create exits/entrances 

## Other Ideas
-Make the length and width of the grid independent and set it equal to the Canvas length and width.
