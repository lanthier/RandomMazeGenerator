A random maze generator on a canvas written in javascript and painted on a Canvas.

## Improvements Made
- 3/16/17
	- Increased Aldous Broder algorithm speed by counting visited instead of checking entire 2D array.
	- Fixed Sidewinder algorithm and removed hot-fix.
	- Refactored variable and function names.
- 3/18/17
	- Included an error message if user tries using an invalid parameter for the algorithm.
	- Provided a basic html template showing the basic use of the generator, including how to clear the canvas.
	- Added a print method for debugging for future development.

## Future Development Plans
- Have more algorithms available.
- Futher improve algorithm speed
- Create exits/entrances

## Other Ideas
- Make the length and width of the grid variable
