# RandomMazeGenerator
A random maze generator on a canvas written in javascript and painted on a Canvas.

# Improvements Made
-Increased Aldous Broder algorithm speed by counting visited instead of checking entire 2D array. { O(n^2) speed previously }
-Fixed Sidewinder algorithm and removed hot-fix.
-Refactored variable and function names.

# Future Development Plans/Ideas
-Have more algorithms available.
-Change variable names inside algorithms
-Futher increase algorithm speed
?Make size of grid equal to canvas size
?
